Introduction

This project involves working to implement authentication systems so users can only access areas of a site they are authorized to.

The core idea of this app is to host an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. 
Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
